                         <p>Mr. T L  Ramkrishan a Palakard Iyer  who migrated from Kerala to Ganeshpuri where he was giving his service to Lord Nityananda Holy Saint like Shirdi Saibaba he served for a long time and one day all of a sudden Swami Nityananda called him and told him that you have served me a lot now is the time you have to migrate from here to my brother`s place. after hearing this  Ramakrshanan was shocked no money in the pocket with his wife and mother told Nityananda that where should I go ? Nityananda replied Swami you just go to Bombay central . and everything will be taken care of. And where is the brothers place? Nityananda replied swami its Shirdi Saibaba.So The Journey starts from Ganesh Puri to Shirdi. A soon as they landed Shirdi it was a new place for them. </p>
                         <p>Ramkrishnan with his wife Challamma and mother searched for small room and they got it.it was charged three rupees per day.this was too costly for them the hunted for monthly rental house and they found it. it was  ten rupees a month where there family started  with a devotees those who come to shirdi they used to order food for them and Ramkrishnan and his wife used to cook in the house and serve the people for which they were paid. There family started with a son named T R Vishwananthan  Iyer (Baba) then second son T R Lakhaman Iyer  then two daughters and the last son T R Radhakrisnan Iyer. Swami started a hotel named as Swami Madras which was founded in 1940 still the name is there. They took part in all the festivals of Baba like Ramanavami Guru Pournima and Dasara(Punyatithi)</p>
                         <p>Where they used to serve food like vada curd on  banana leaves to the Saibaba sansthan which was free they never in their life charged Saibaba Sansthan for any of the service .I forgot to say very important thing in this that Chellamma the wife of Ramakrsihnan Dreamt about Baba saying that chellamma I m also your son I am feeling very cold can you serve hot water for my bath and chellamma started this and still the water for the holy bath is served from the Iyer family till date.</p>
                         <p>They used to feed the needy In shirdi as a annadanam the process was going for a long time after Ramakrishanan  T R Vishwanathan  Took over swami madras and Stared to do the same. Now his son the Third generation Mr. Prasad Vishwanathan Iyer is doing the same on Footsteps of his family.</p>
                         <p>In 2004 Vishwanath Iyer (Baba) thought of making this annadanam as Trust and he found Shri Sai Bhaghavathi Pratishthan. In This Trust He is the founder Chair person as well as Prasad Iyer is also a Trustee Member. </p>
